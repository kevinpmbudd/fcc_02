#Portfolio - Free Code Camp - Project 02

This is a portfolio of my front end work. This is from my studies with [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com). As part of their Front End Certification Track this is a page using Bootstrap to style a single page representing some of my work and providing contact to other outlets.
